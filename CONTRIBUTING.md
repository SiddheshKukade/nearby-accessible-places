# How to contribute

Support and contributions from the open source community are essential for keeping
Our Project up to date and always improving! There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow to keep the project consistent, as well as allow us to keep
maintaining MERN in a reasonable amount of time.

## Creating an Issue

## Before you create a new Issue:
* Check the [Issues](https://github.com/SiddheshKukade/nearby-accessible-places/issues) on Github to ensure one doesn't already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue, including the steps to reproduce the issue.
* If it's a new feature, enhancement, or restructure, Explain your reasoning on why you think it should be added, as well as a particular use case.

## Making Changes
* Fork the repo
* Clone your fork
* Create a topic branch from the master branch.
* Make changes and try to make the tests pass. If you cant or need help then commit what you have with --no-verify and make a pull request.
* If you get things working, add your changed files with `git add` and run `npm run commit` to get an interactive prompt for creating a commit message that follows [our standards](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md).
  You'll notice that there are git hooks in place which will run testing, linting, etc. (unless you commit with `--no-verify`).
* Check for unnecessary whitespace / changes with `git diff --check` before committing.
    * Also check that your code is formatted properly with spaces.
* Make Sure you have added any tests necessary to test your code.
	* Run __all__ the tests to ensure nothing else was accidentally broken.
	* Don't rely on the existing tests to see if you've broken code elsewhere; test the changes you made in a browser too!   
* Push your changes to your fork
* Create a pull request.
* Iterate on the solution.
* Get merged!
* Update the Documentation to go along with any changes in functionality / improvements in a separate pull request.

## Commit Message Guidelines
```
Header
Blank Line
Body
Blank Line
Footer

The header should look like:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

The body should have any necessary detailed info about the commit:
An example, references as to where this idea came from, etc.

The footer should have all the issues tagged:
Fixes #123, Fixes #456

So a commit should like like:
feat(users): Add new Yahoo authentication

Yahoo authentication idea proposed by @codydaig
Example implementation in file.js

Fixes #82
```

* Types:
    * feat - Features, Enhancements, and overall Improvements
    * fix - Fixes, Bugs, HotFixes, etc...
    * doc - Changes to the Documentation and doesn't actually touch any code.
* Scope:
    * The scope should be where the change took place.
    * Examples: users, core, config, articles
* Subject:
    * The subject line should be clear and concise as to what is being accomplished in the commit.
* General Rules:
    * No Line in the Commit message can be longer than 80 characters.
 


## Submitting the Pull Request

* Push your changes to your topic branch on your fork of the repo.
* Submit a pull request from your topic branch to the master branch on the MERN repository.
* Be sure to tag any issues your pull request is taking care of / contributing to.
	* By adding "Closes #xyz" to a commit message will auto close the issue once the pull request is merged in.
* Small changes are usually accepted and merged in within a week (provided that 2 collaborators give the okay)
* Larger changes usually spark further discussion and possible changes prior to being merged in.
